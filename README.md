# introduction to machine learning and data mining 
In a group of 3 we worked on this project. We used the data set HPRICE2 which is taken from "Introductory Econometrics: A Modern Approach, 6e" by Jeffrey M. Wooldridge. In the regression problem, we implemented ridge regression and ANN for regression to predict the housing prices using the different attributes given. A classification task based on an attribute was done using KNN, logistic regression and decision tree.
